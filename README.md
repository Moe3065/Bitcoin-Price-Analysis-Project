# Bitcoin Price Prediction Analysis

This project explores various time series forecasting models to predict Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices. The analysis is based on historical daily price data from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2024, sourced from Yahoo Finance.

Three primary modeling techniques are implemented and compared:
1.  **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average):** A classical statistical model for time series forecasting.
2.  **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** A type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.
3.  **GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity):** A model focused on forecasting the volatility of returns.

The objective is to evaluate the performance of these models in predicting Bitcoin prices and understanding its volatility, providing insights into their applicability for cryptocurrency market analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+ (Python 3.11 was used for development)
*   pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  Clone this repository (or download the source code).
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Bitcoin_Price_Analysis_Project
    ```
3.  Install the required Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Analysis

The analysis scripts are designed to be run in sequence:

1.  **Data Preparation:**
    ```bash
    python code/01_data_preparation.py
    ```
    This script will download the latest Bitcoin data from Yahoo Finance for the specified period (2015-2024) and save it to the `data/` directory in both raw and processed formats.

2.  **ARIMA Model:**
    ```bash
    python code/02_arima_model.py
    ```
    This script loads the processed data, fits an ARIMA model, generates forecasts, evaluates performance, and saves a forecast plot to the `report/` directory.

3.  **LSTM Model:**
    ```bash
    python code/03_lstm_model.py
    ```
    This script implements an LSTM neural network for price prediction, evaluates its performance, and saves a forecast plot to the `report/` directory.

4.  **GARCH Model:**
    ```bash
    python code/04_garch_model.py
    ```
    This script fits a GARCH model to the log returns to analyze and forecast volatility, saving a plot of the conditional variance to the `report/` directory.

## Key Findings (from the report)

*   The **LSTM model** demonstrated superior performance in predicting Bitcoin prices compared to the traditional ARIMA model, showing lower RMSE and MAE values on the test set.
*   The **GARCH model** effectively captured the changing volatility of Bitcoin returns, providing valuable insights for risk assessment.
*   The analysis suggests that while advanced machine learning models like LSTM show promise for price prediction, understanding volatility through models like GARCH is also crucial in the context of cryptocurrency markets.

For a detailed discussion of the methodology, results, and conclusions, please refer to the `Bitcoin_Price_Analysis_Report.pdf` located in the `report/` directory.

## Skills Demonstrated

*   **Time Series Analysis:** ARIMA, LSTM, GARCH modeling.
*   **Python Programming:** Data manipulation (Pandas, NumPy), model implementation (Statsmodels, Pmdarima, TensorFlow/Keras, ARCH), data visualization (Matplotlib).
*   **Data Science Workflow:** Data fetching (yfinance), preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.
*   **Financial Data Analysis:** Working with cryptocurrency price data, understanding log returns and volatility.
*   **Machine Learning:** Application of neural networks (LSTM) for forecasting.

This project showcases the ability to apply diverse modeling techniques to complex financial data, interpret results, and present findings in a structured manner.
